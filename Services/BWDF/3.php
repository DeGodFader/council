                    <h3 class="text_align_center"><strong>You should register the death within five days.&nbsp;</strong></h3>
                    <p>To register a death, you must be a qualified informant (please see the list of qualified informants below)</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>relative of deceased&nbsp;</li>
                        <li>someone present at the death</li>
                        <li>the occupier, e.g. the matron or owner of a nursing home or the Hospital Administrator of the premises where the death occurred</li>
                        <li>the person arranging the funeral (this is the person signing the paperwork for the funeral director, not the funeral director themselves)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2 style="font-weight:bold;">Booking an Appointment</h2>
                    <p>All deaths must be registered within<strong> five days of the date of death</strong>, the only exception to this is where a referral has been made to the Coroner.&nbsp;A Coroner's Officer will advise you when you are able to make an appointment.</p>
                    <p><a href="" target="_blank">The GOV.UK website</a>&nbsp;provides a comprehensive toolkit that will help you determine what you need to do in order to register a death. This will tell you how to register the death, based on the circumstances, and what information you will need to provide to the registrar.</p>
                    <p>From 25th March 2022 all death registration appointments change back to being ‘in person’ appointments only, this is due to the coronavirus Act 2019 coming to an end. This means the informant of a death registration must attend an appointment at one of the Register Offices in the district where the death occurred for the registration to take place. <strong>Please only book the appointment once the surgery or coroners’ office have informed you that paperwork has been emailed to Worcestershire Register</strong> <strong>Office.&nbsp;</strong></p>
                    <p>The Registration Service may contact you, if you have not booked an appointment and the statutory deadline is close.</p>
                    <p>Once the death has been registered, the form for the funeral will still be sent directly to the funeral director and burial/cremation authority via email on your behalf.<br>
                    <br>
                    <a class="button" href="" target="_blank">Book your appointment</a></p>
                    <p>If you need further clarification,&nbsp;please complete an enquiry form and one of our dedicated team will respond to you.</p>

                    <p><a class="button" href="">Visit the Coroner's website</a></p>
                    <p>Her Majesty’s Coroner holds office under the Crown and is an independent judicial officer.</p>
                    <p>The role of the Coroner is to investigate and record the causes and circumstances of all sudden deaths where the cause is not known, violent or unnatural deaths and any death which occurred whilst the deceased was in lawful custody.</p>
                    <p>The Coroner's Service for Worcestershire endeavours to provide a caring, efficient service making the processes involved as easily comprehensible and accessible as possible.</p>
